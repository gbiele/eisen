This is a small project about prediciting sferritin values from questionnaire data in MoBa.
The analysis uses Bayesian shrinkage priors as described [here](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/bayes_sparse_regression.html) and imputes missing values during fitting.

The html document can be viewed [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gbiele/eisen/blob/master/test_horseshoe.html).
